# MNIST

Implemented an ensemble learning system using XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to identify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. Key tasks involved data preprocessing, model training/validation, and performance evaluation. Successfully split training data for validation, ensuring robust model tuning. The best-performing model, selected based on validation metrics, achieved notable accuracy on the MNIST test set, demonstrating effective use of ensemble methods in machine learning.
